I have always wanted to run away from life but there's no better way to experience reality other than a game! If you want to work just find some pedestals to interact with. There are some peaceful creatures who will look at you when you pass-by :)

Use:

WASD/ arrow keys - to move

shift - run

E - interact

press esc to enter and exit focus

If not already in focus, then press escape

play on itch.io [here](https://abc-hacker.itch.io/peace-simulator)
